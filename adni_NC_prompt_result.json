Some of the notable features include:1. Normal Brain Volume: NC individuals typically exhibit normal brain volume, with no significant atrophy or shrinkage compared to age-matched individuals.2. Intact Hippocampus: The hippocampus is a region of the brain associated with memory and learning. In NC individuals, the hippocampus tends to show normal volume and shape, without significant signs of atrophy.3. Minimal White Matter Hyperintensities: White matter hyperintensities are areas of increased signal intensity in white matter regions, often associated with small vessel disease. NC individuals generally have minimal or no white matter hyperintensities.4. Absence of Cortical Thinning: Cortical thinning refers to the reduction in thickness of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain. NC individuals typically exhibit a normal thickness of the cortex without significant thinning.It's important to note that these features are general observations and may vary depending on the specific imaging protocols, analysis techniques, and population characteristics used in different studies..",
